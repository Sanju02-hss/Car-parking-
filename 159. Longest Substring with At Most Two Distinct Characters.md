### **Description** ###
Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t  that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
```

### **Solution** ###

Now one could write down the algortihm.

* Return `N` if the string length `N` is smaller than `3`.
* Set both set pointers in the beginning of the string `left = 0` and `right = 0` and init max substring length `max_len = 0`.
* While `right` pointer is less than `N`:
    * If hashmap contains less than `3` distinct characters, add the current character `s[right]` in the hashmap and move right pointer to the right.
    * If hashmap contains `3` distinct characters, remove the leftmost character from the hashmap and move the `left` pointer so that sliding window contains again `2` distinct characters only.
    * Update `max_len`.

O(n) runtime, O(1) space

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(String s) {
        int length = s.length();
        if (length < 3) {
            return length;
        }
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        HashMap<Character, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
        int max_len = 0;
        
        while (right < length) {
            if (hashMap.size() < 3) {
                hashMap.put(s.charAt(right), right++);
                // rignt pointers is not included, points to the outside one
            }
                
            if (hashMap.size() == 3) {
                int deleteIndex = Collections.min(hashMap.values());
                hashMap.remove(s.charAt(deleteIndex));
                left = deleteIndex + 1;
            }
            
            // because the right pointer position, so we dont + 1 here
            max_len = Math.max(max_len, right - left);
        }
        return max_len;
    }
}
