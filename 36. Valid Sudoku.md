### **Description** ###
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

Example 1:

Input:  
[  
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],  
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],  
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],  
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],  
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],  
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],  
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],  
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],  
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]  
]  
Output: true  
Example 2:

Input:  
[  
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],  
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],  
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],  
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],  
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],  
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],  
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],  
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],  
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]  
]  
Output: false  
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
The given board size is always 9x9.

### **Solution 1** ###
The first two lines is intended to get all top left corner index of nine cubics. It is a trick here. When you traverse i from 0 to 8. Here RowIndex and ColIndex will traverse through all the possible top left index of the cubics.

The third line is intended to get traverse through all the elements in the cubic confirmed by the i in the first lines. when j traverse from 0 - 8, it will just traverse through all possible index of the cubic assigned by the fixed i value in the outer loop.

This solution is very tricky, the definition of i, j varies between loops and that's also why he can get such a concise solution. Hope this could be helpful.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        for (int row = 0; row < 9; row++) {
            Set<Character> rows = new HashSet<>();
            Set<Character> columns = new HashSet<>();
            Set<Character> cube = new HashSet<>();
            for (int col = 0; col < 9; col++) {
                if (board[row][col] != '.' && !rows.add(board[row][col])) {
                    return false;
                }
                if (board[col][row] != '.' && !columns.add(board[col][row])) {
                    return false;
                }
                int rowIndex = 3 * (row / 3);
                int colIndex = 3 * (row % 3);
                if (board[rowIndex + col / 3][colIndex + col % 3] != '.' && !cube.add(board[rowIndex + col / 3][colIndex + col % 3])) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
