 *
 * Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a
 * linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO
 * (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to
 * the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".
 * 
 * One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the
 * spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes
 * full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of
 * the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new
 * values.
 * 
 * Your implementation should support following operations:
 * 
 * 
 * MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.
 * Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return
 * -1.
 * Rear: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return
 * -1.
 * enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if
 * the operation is successful.
 * deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the
 * operation is successful.
 * isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
 * isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * MyCircularQueue circularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3); // set the size to
 * be 3
 * circularQueue.enQueue(1);  // return true
 * circularQueue.enQueue(2);  // return true
 * circularQueue.enQueue(3);  // return true
 * circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return false, the queue is full
 * circularQueue.Rear();  // return 3
 * circularQueue.isFull();  // return true
 * circularQueue.deQueue();  // return true
 * circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return true
 * circularQueue.Rear();  // return 4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * All values will be in the range of [0, 1000].
 * The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 1000].
 * Please do not use the built-in Queue library.
 *
