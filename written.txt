1A

The loop is NOT an infinite loop.

There would NOT be any error.

The program would print the following:
Danger, Will Robinson!
Danger, Will Robinson!
Danger, Will Robinson!


1B

The loop is NOT infinite.

There would NOT be any error.

The loop will not be executed because 'level' is not greater then 'danger'
The program would print the following:
Lost in Space!


1C

The loop is an infinite loop.

There would NOT be any error.

The loop will continue to print infinite lines of "Jupiter-2" as 'level' is not never updated and will remain lesser then danger always.
The program would print the following:
Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 Jupiter-2 ...... infinitely

#Option 1 would correctly prompt the user.
This is because of the boolean operator 'AND' which makes the statement true IF ANY ONLY IF day is not "Sat" or "Sun". Otherwise, it will skip the line inside.
And so, it will print: Thank you!


2B

In Option 2 the while loop can be false IF AND ONLY IF day is SAT and SUN both.
Hence, it is like an infinte loop, because it will continue to execute the line till the while loop is false.
2. It thinks good inputs (like “Sat”) are invalid.
