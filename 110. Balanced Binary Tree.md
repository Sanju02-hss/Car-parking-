### **Description** ###
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

> a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example 1:

Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
Return true.

Example 2:

Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:
```
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
```
Return false.

### **Solution 1** ###
Recursive  
The first method checks whether the tree is balanced strictly according to the definition of balanced binary tree: the difference between the heights of the two sub trees are not bigger than 1, and both the left sub tree and right sub tree are also balanced. With the helper function depth(), we could easily write the code;  
Get height of the left and right children and check the diff for each node in the tree  
**Time complexity:** O(nlogn)
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return true;
        }
        int leftHeight = maxDepth(root.left);
        int rightHeight = maxDepth(root.right);
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
            return false;
        }
        return isBalanced(root.left) && isBalanced(root.right);
    }

    private int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int left = maxDepth(root.left);
        int right = maxDepth(root.right);
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```

### **Solution 2** ###
The second method is based on DFS. Instead of calling depth() explicitly for each child node, we return the height of the current node in DFS recursion. When the sub tree of the current node (inclusive) is balanced, the function dfsHeight() returns a non-negative value as the height. Otherwise -1 is returned. According to the leftHeight and rightHeight of the two children, the parent node could check if the sub tree
is balanced, and decides its return value.  
In this bottom up approach, each node in the tree only need to be accessed once. Thus the time complexity is O(N), better than the first solution.
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        return DFSHeight(root) != -1;
    }
    
    private int DFSHeight(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int leftHeight = DFSHeight(root.left);
        if (leftHeight == -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        int rightHeight = DFSHeight(root.right);
        if (rightHeight == -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}
```
