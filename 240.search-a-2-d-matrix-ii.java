 * Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
 * This matrix has the following properties:
 * 
 * 
 * Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
 * Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Consider the following matrix:
 * 
 * 
 * [
 * ⁠ [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
 * ⁠ [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
 * ⁠ [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
 * ⁠ [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
 * ⁠ [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * Given target = 5, return true.
 * 
 * Given target = 20, return false.

/**
 * We start search the matrix from top right corner, initialize the current position to top right corner, 
 * if the target is greater than the value in current position, 
 * then the target can not be in entire row of current position because the row is sorted, 
 * if the target is less than the value in current position, 
 * then the target can not in the entire column because the column is sorted too. 
 * We can rule out one row or one column each time, so the time complexity is O(m+n).
