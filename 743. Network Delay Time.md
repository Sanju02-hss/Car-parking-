### **Description** ###
 There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

Note:

    N will be in the range [1, 100].
    K will be in the range [1, N].
    The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
    All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 1 <= w <= 100.

### ** Solution 1** ###
Dijkstra's Algorithm with basic implementation 
We use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from our source to all targets. This is a textbook algorithm, refer to this link for more details.

Dijkstra's algorithm is based on repeatedly making the candidate move that has the least distance travelled.

In our implementations below, we showcase both O(N^2) (basic) and O(Nlog⁡N) (heap) approaches.

```java
class Solution {
    Map<Integer, Integer> dist;
    public int networkDelayTime(int[][] times, int N, int K) {
        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> graph = new HashMap();
        for (int[] edge : times) {
            if (!graph.containsKey(edge[0])) {
                graph.put(edge[0], new ArrayList<int[]>());
            }
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(new int[]{edge[1], edge[2]});
        }
        dist = new HashMap<>();
        for (int node = 1; node <= N; node++) {
            dist.put(node, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        dist.put(K, 0);
        boolean[] seen = new boolean[N + 1];
        
        while (true) {
            int candNode = -1;
            int candDist = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
                if (!seen[i] && dist.get(i) < candDist) {
                    candDist = dist.get(i);
                    candNode = i;
                }
            }
            
            if (candNode < 0) {
                break;
            }
            seen[candNode] = true;
            if (graph.containsKey(candNode)) {
                for (int[] info : graph.get(candNode)) {
                    dist.put(info[0], Math.min(dist.get(info[0]), dist.get(candNode) + info[1]));
                }
            }
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int cand : dist.values()) {
            if (cand == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                return -1;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, cand);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
