 *
 * Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears three times
 * except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
 * it without using extra memory?

 * Example 1:

 * Input: [2,2,3,2]

 /**
  * The usual bit manipulation code is bit hard to get and replicate. 
  I like to think about the number in 32 bits and just count how many 1s are there in each bit, and sum %= 3 will clear it once it reaches 3. 
  After running for all the numbers for each bit, if we have a 1, then that 1 belongs to the single number, 
  we can simply move it back to its spot by doing ans |= sum << i;

This has complexity of O(32n), which is essentially O(n) and very easy to think and implement. 
Plus, you get a general solution for any times of occurrence. Say all the numbers have 5 times, just do sum %= 5.

            for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (((nums[j] >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                    sum++;
                    sum %= 3;
                }
            }
            
            // if it is 1, move it back to origin position
