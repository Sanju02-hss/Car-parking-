 * Testcase Example:  '123'
 *
 * Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 123
 * Output: 321
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: -123
 * Output: -321
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 120
 * Output: 21
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers
 * within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose
 * of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed
 * integer overflows.

/**
We want to repeatedly "pop" the last digit off of xx and "push" it to the back of the \text{rev}rev. In the end, \text{rev}rev will be the reverse of the xx.

To "pop" and "push" digits without the help of some auxiliary stack/array, we can use math.

//pop operation:
pop = x % 10;
x /= 10;

//push operation:
temp = rev * 10 + pop;
rev = temp;

However, this approach is dangerous, because the statement temp = rev * 10 + pop can cause overflow.

Luckily, it is easy to check beforehand whether or this statement would cause an overflow.

    public int reverse(int x) {
        int rev = 0;
        while (x != 0) {
            int pop = x % 10;
            x /= 10;
            if (rev > Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && pop > 7)) return 0;
            if (rev < Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 && pop < -8)) return 0;
            rev = rev * 10 + pop;
        }
        return rev;
    }
